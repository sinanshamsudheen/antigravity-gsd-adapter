## Attribution

This adapter modifies and redistributes workflow files from the "get-shit-done" 
project (https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) by updating path 
references for Antigravity compatibility.

The original get-shit-done workflows and templates retain their original 
copyright and are used in accordance with their terms. All credit for the 
workflow design and methodology goes to the original author.

This adapter only provides:
- Installation script (setup-gsd.sh)
- Integration guide (GUIDE.md)
- Example files
- Path reference updates (.claude → .agent)
